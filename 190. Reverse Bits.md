### Bitwise operation

bin() function in Python3 is a good choice
````

class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        # s = bin(n)
        s = ""
        a = 0   
        for i in range(32):
            a = n%2
            s = s+str(a)
            n=n//2 
        return int(s,2)
